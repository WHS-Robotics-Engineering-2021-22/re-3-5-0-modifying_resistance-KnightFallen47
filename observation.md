All of the circuts use the same resistors, but they all have different currents. The first is using the resistors separately and share the same power source.
The second is a straight so it combines both of the resistors together to make a super high resistance. The third is seperate but joins back at the end so it increases
the current at the end but is slow when it first sepearates. When you would use resitors in a series is when you need a specific resistance and dont have one
resistor so you could use them in a series.
